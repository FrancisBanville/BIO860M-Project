## Report (Due February 14 2021)

The report should be around **10 pages**, **double-spaced**, not including the references.
You should be citing at least **10-15 primary literature sources** (scientific articles) for your
reports. You can use whatever format for citations/references you prefer, just be
consistent. The format of the report should follow the standard format for a scientific
article (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion). An abstract is not required. Figures
and tables count towards the page total so I encourage you to only choose the
figures/tables that are absolutely necessary to tell your story. If you need to you can
present additional figures and tables in an appendix but the report should be readable
without having to refer to the appendix all the time
