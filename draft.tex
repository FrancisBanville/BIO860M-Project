\textbf{\sffamily Abstract: }Biodiversity drives various aspects of
ecosystem functioning, including biomass production and community
stability. However, many measures of network structure are also
associated with ecosystem functioning. Considering the scaling of
network structure with species richness, the effect of biodiversity on
the functioning of ecological communities might partly be due to its
intimate relationship with network structure. Here I describe the
biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship under the unifying
framework of ecological networks. Simulating biomass flows in food webs
and comparing different structural equation models, I show that BEF
relationships are best described by both direct and indirect effects of
biodiversity on ecosystem functioning.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

One of the main reasons for preserving biodiversity is to maintain
ecosystem services, which are supported by associated ecological
processes (Isbell et al. 2017). Perhaps the simplest and most studied
measure of biodiversity is species richness (i.e.~the number of species
in a biological community). Species richness has been associated to
various ecological functions, including nutrient retention (Zhang et al.
2010), decomposition (Dangles and Malmqvist 2004), productivity
(Mittelbach et al. 2001), and ecosystem stability (Ives, Klug, and Gross
2000). The biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships
describe these associations, and one of the main goals of biodiversity
science has been to understand the mechanisms driving these
relationships in various systems. Niche complementarity (Loreau 2000),
species regional complementarity (Bond and Chase 2002), and mutualistic
interactions (Schleuning, Fründ, and García 2015) are examples of
well-known mechanisms responsable for the BEF relationships.

The structure of ecological networks has also been associated with
ecosystem functioning and other ecological processes (Pascual et al.
2006; Gómez, Perfectti, and Jordano 2011). For example, food webs having
a high connectance (i.e.~highly connected webs) are typically more
robust to random losses of species (Dunne, Williams, and Martinez 2002).
Trophic interactions can also directly impact ecosystem productivity
(Worm and Duffy 2003).

Because of the scaling of many measures of network structure with
species richness, including connectance (MacDonald, Banville, and Poisot
2020), it is difficult to disentangle the direct effects of biodiversity
on ecosystem functioning from its indirect effets trough food-web
structure. In other words, are biodiversity-functioning relationships in
food webs mainly driven by their total number of species or by their
emerging structure? This knowledge will notably help us implement better
conservation strategies by targeting more specifically different
ecosystem properties to preserve. I expect that both direct and indirect
effects should be important pathways in BEF relationships. In this
study, I will examine what drives biomass production and population
stability in food webs. To do so, I will simulate biomass flows using a
bioenergetic model of food-web dynamics and compare different structural
equation models of biodiversity (i.e.~species richness), food-web
structure, and ecosystem functions.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

All food webs used in this study were queried from
\href{https://mangal.io/\#/}{\texttt{mangal.io}}, an extensive database
of published ecological networks worldwide (Poisot et al. 2016).
Networks archived on Mangal are multilayer networks, i.e.~different
types of interactions can be found in the same network. I considered as
food webs all networks whose interactions were mainly of trophic type
(i.e.~predation and herbivory interactions). When writing these lines,
235 networks correspond to that definition. I removed the largest food
web (\(S\) = 714 species) from my dataset since it significantly
increased total simulation time. My final dataset thus contained a total
of 234 food webs whose number of species ranged between 5 and 106
(\(\bar{S}\) = 32.6, \(s\) = 19.1).

\hypertarget{food-web-measures-and-biomass-flows}{%
\subsection{Food-web measures and biomass
flows}\label{food-web-measures-and-biomass-flows}}

I measured \(\alpha\)-diversity by the number of nodes (species) \(S\)
in each network. Food-web structure was also described by their
connectance and nestedness. Connectance represents the proportion of
realized links in ecological networks (\(C=L/S^2\), where \(L\) is the
number of interactions), and has been associated with many other
properties of network structure (Poisot and Gravel 2014), including
nestedness. The nestedness of an ecological network represents the
extent to which species interacting with specialists are a subset of
species interacting with generalists. Nestedness was estimated by the
spectral radius (i.e.~the largest eigenvalue) of the adjacency matrix
(Staniczenko, Kopp, and Allesina 2013). Because of its tight association
with network modularity (Fortuna et al. 2010), computing the nestedness
of a network is comparable to estimating its modularity (i.e.~network
compartmentalization). However, nestedness is perhaps orders of
magnitude easier and faster to measure than modularity.

Moreover, ecosystem functioning was simulated using the model of Yodzis
and Innes (1992) of biomass flows in food webs, implemented in Julia
v0.7.0 or newer (Delmas et al. 2021). Indeed, to the best of my
knowledge, no extensive dataset of species interactions and ecosystem
functioning were available. In this context, I had to rely on
first-order simulations to conduct my analysis. All model parameters
(e.g.~carrying capacities, body-mass ratios, growth rates, coefficients
of interspecific competition, \emph{etc.}) were kept to their default
values (Delmas et al. 2017, 2021). In the absence of empirical data on
species biomass, the initial biomass of every species in the model were
sampled from a uniform distribution \(U(0,1)\). This ensured that no
further biases regarding initial values were introduced arbitrarily in
the simulation process. Simulations of biomass flows were performed for
500 timesteps, and repeated 50 times for each food web. Because 13 food
webs could not be simulated appropriately, I ended up with 221 simulated
webs whose total biomass and population stability were measured and
averaged over the last 10 timesteps. Total biomass was estimated as the
sum of all species biomass at the end of simulation, whereas population
stability was measured as the mean of the negative coefficient of
variation of species biomass (Delmas et al. 2017). I used the total
biomass at the end of the simulation as a proxy of biomass production. I
identified the median of both simulated measures for each web, as well
as their 95\% percentile intervals (2.5\% and 97.5\% quantiles).

\hypertarget{structural-equation-models}{%
\subsection{Structural equation
models}\label{structural-equation-models}}

To identify which emerging ecosystem properties drove the functioning of
food webs, I evaluated the fit of seven structural equation models
(SEMs) against my measured and simulated data. The most saturated model
(model 6) is represented by eq.~\ref{eq:mod6}.

\[Y = \beta_0 + \beta_{YS}S + \beta_{YC}C + \beta_{YN}N\]
\[ N = \beta_1 + \beta_{NS}S + \beta_{NC}C\]
\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:mod6}{}{ C = \beta_2 + \beta_{CS}S, }\label{eq:mod6}\end{equation}

where \(Y\) is the predicted variable (i.e.~either total biomass or
population stability), \(S\) is species richness, \(C\) the connectance,
and \(N\) the nestedness of all food webs. The subscripts \({ij}\) of
the parameters indicate the hypothesized causal relationship between the
corresponding variables \(i\) and \(j\) (i.e.~\(j \rightarrow i\)). The
parameters \(\beta_0\), \(\beta_1\), and \(\beta_2\) are the model
intercepts. All parameters were estimated in model 6 using the
\texttt{lavaan} package v.0.6-7 in R. I imposed further structure on the
other six models (see tbl.~\ref{tbl:models}).

of a food web. The parameters \(\beta_0\), \(\beta_1\), and \(\beta_2\)

These seven structural equation models were fit against both \(Y\)
variables (i.e.~total biomass and population stability) independently. I
performed model selection using the Akaike information criterion (AIC)
for both variables.

All code and data to reproduce this project are available on GitHub

The most saturated model (model 6) was the best fit model for both the
prediction of total biomass and population stability
(tbl.~\ref{tbl:AIC}). However, model 5 was also a really good fit to the
data, with a \(\Delta\) AIC of 4.1 for the two predicted variables. In
both cases, model 6 had an Akaike weight of 88.7\% and model 5 had the
remaining 11.3\%. Model 6 only differed from model 5 by the imposed
relationship between species richness and nestedness. Therefore, using
an ensemble model did not seem necessary to me. Model 6 was thus
selected as the unique best structural equation model.

associated with the total number of species and the nestedness of food
webs at the beginning of the simulation, but negatively associated with
connectance (tbl.~\ref{tbl:path_biomass}). However, since both measures
of food-web structure were associated with species richness, species
richness also shaped total biomass through these indirect pathways.

These relationships were weaker when model 6 was used to predict
population stability (tbl.~\ref{tbl:path_stability}). Population
stability was not significantly associated with either measure of
network structure, but was only weakly associated with species richness.

Bivariate relationships between measures of ecosystem functioning and
measures of biodiversity and food-web structure were plotted in
fig.~\ref{fig:bivariate}. We can identify the positive relationship
between total biomass and species richness, and its negative
relationship with connectance. However, the confidence intervals around
the point estimates of total biomass were wider for food webs with more
species and narrower for networks with high connectance. On the other
hand, the weak relationship between population stability and species
richness is not easily observable in fig.~\ref{fig:bivariate}.

\subsection{Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning: direct
pathways}\label{biodiversity-and-ecosystem-functioning-direct-pathways}}

My study suggests that biodiversity remains an important driver of
ecosystem functioning, independently of food-web structure. First, the
total biomass of a biological community at the end of my simulations
increased with the total number of species. The positive relationship
between biomass productivity and species richness uncovered in my study
was previously observed in various systems and taxa (Mittelbach et al.
2001) and at different spatial scales (Gonzalez et al. 2020). More
diverse systems might indeed use resources and nutrients more
efficiently than homogeneous communities because of niche
complementarities (Tilman, Wedin, and Knops 1996).

Moreover, I found that the temporal stability of species biomass also
increased with species richness. This is in agreement with the work of
Ives, Klug, and Gross (2000) and Gross et al. (2014). Species typically
have different levels of tolerance to the variation of environmental
conditions and to the variation of other species' abundances. A decrease
of biomass from a given species might be compensated by an increase of
biomass from another species in the community. A high number of species
might promote ecosystem stability because of a higher probability of
finding complementary species. However, the positive relationship
between population stability and species richness uncovered in this
study seems to be in disagreement with the work of May (1972), Allesina
and Tang (2012), and MacDonald, Banville, and Poisot (2020), who found
that the probability of a network to be stable decreases with species
richness. This might however be due to differences in the definitions
and measures used to describe ecosystem stability (biomass stability vs
food-web stability).

The relationship between other measures of biodiversity, such as species
evenness and measures of \(\beta\)-diversity, and ecosystem functioning
should also be investigated alongside measures of network structure.
This might unveil intriguing aspects of the BEF relationship in the
light of food-web structure.

\hypertarget{biodiversity-and-ecosystem-functioning-indirect-pathways}{%
\subsection{Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning: indirect
pathways}\label{biodiversity-and-ecosystem-functioning-indirect-pathways}}

Species richness also drove food-web functioning through indirect
pathways. For example, species richness was negatively associated with
food-web connectance, which was positively associated with total
biomass. This was however in contrast with the relationship between
species richness and population stability, which did not have any
indirect pathways through food-web structure.

The bioenergetic model of biomass flows of Yodzis and Innes (1992) and
Delmas et al. (2017) allowed me to simulate ecosystem functioning of
many published food webs. This model was useful to make first order
predictions of total biomass and population stability. However, many
parameter values were set to their default values or sampled from a
non-biased distribution (i.e.~a uniform distribution), although they
were probably system specific. To the best of my knowledge, no empirical
data was available to validate this choice of parameter values in a
broad range of food webs. When collecting data on species interactions,
ecologists should estimate as much as possible the biomass of individual
species. This would enable the conduction of more extensive studies on
biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Overall, my results nevertheless
highlight the importance of considering network structure when
describing the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship,
especially with regards to biomass production.
