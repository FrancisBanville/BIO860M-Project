  "description": "Biodiversity drives various aspects of ecosystem functioning, including biomass production and community stability. However, many measures of network structure are also associated with ecosystem functioning. Considering the scaling of network structure with species richness, the effect of biodiversity on the functioning of ecological communities might partly be due to its intimate relationship with network structure. Here I describe the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship under the unifying framework of ecological networks. Simulating biomass flows in food webs and comparing different structural equation models, I show that BEF relationships are best described by both direct and indirect effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning.",
